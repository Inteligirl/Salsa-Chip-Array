# C++ Salsa Sales Report [Using Parallel Arrays]

This programming challenge was not assigned. I wanted to practice more with arrays.

## Project specifications:

Write a program that lets a maker of chips and salsa keep track of their sales for five different types of salsa they produce: mild, medium, sweet, hot, and zesty. It should use two parallel five-element arrays: an array of strings that holds the five salsa names and an array of integers that holds the number of jars sold during the past month for each salsa type. The salsa names should be stored using an initialization list at the time the name array is created. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of jars sold for each type. Once this sales data has been entered, the program should produce a report that displays sales for each salsa type, total sales, and the names of the highest selling and lowest selling products.

## Thought process

I did this myself as extra practice. I learn best when I try to make a program and encounter problems. I have no idea how to manipulate parallel arrays yet. My first submission is pieces of code from other projects that contain logic I may or may not need. I generally spend a little time piecing together logic then manipulate it for my project. I seem to reverse engineer others codes to pull out the lines I need. I still continue to focus on syntax understanding and creating objects.
